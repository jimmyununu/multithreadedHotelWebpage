Overview
The Multithreaded Hotel Webpage is a modern web application designed to support internationalization (i18n) 
and localization (l10n) for a seamless user experience across different regions and languages. The project 
integrates a multithreaded back-end built with Java Spring Boot and a dynamic front-end using Angular. 
The application showcases hotel scheduling, displaying multilingual welcome messages and price formats in 
various currencies (USD, CAD, EUR).
